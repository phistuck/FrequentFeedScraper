FrequentFeedScraper
===================

Frequently scrapes feeds that have few entries at a time, but update frequently and creates new feeds with much more unique entries.

Originally built for scraping codereviews.chromium.org (it provides a twenty entry feed, but entries are added every several seconds during work hours, so feed readers such as Feedly cannot keep up because they are scraping it once in two hours at most), but extended in version 2 to support more feeds.
